Artificial intelligence-based computational techniques allow the rapid exploration of the chemical space. Recent algorithmic advancements in modeling neural networks provide an automatic and extraordinary means for molecule representation, in contrast, to traditional manually designed fingerprints or descriptors. Although the implementation of graph-based methods for chemical properties calculation offers multiple advantages, its implementation demands in-depth domain knowledge and programming skills. To address this, here we introduce deepMOA, an end-to-end web service featuring a conglomerate of powerful graph-based neural networks methods for model generation for classification or regression tasks. The Graphical User Interface of deepMOA supports highly configurable parameters support for model tuning, generation, and testing of the user-supplied query molecules. <I>deepMOA</I> supports four widely accepted methods for graph-based model generation i.e., Graph Convolution Network (GCN) (Duvenaud et al., 2015), Graph Attention Network (GAT) (Veličković et al., 2018), Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) (Ha, Sun and Xie, 2016), and AttentiveFP (Xiong et al., 2020). Importantly, for all the aforementioned methods, deepMOA also supports cross-validations and returns comprehensive results, both in graphical as well as tabular formats. One of the key highlighting features of deepMOA is that it allows live tracking of the main steps involved in the model generation. To our knowledge, deepMOA is the first open-source and multi-functional graph-based deep learning framework supporting web service to date.
